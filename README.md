# Harrowed Fortress

This is a Unity 6 Universal 2D project for developing a 2D Survival Horror RPG named Harrowed Fortress.

# Design

Art Style: 2D pixel-art with both isometric and side-scrolling perspectives.

# Core loop:

- player is in world map
- player enters fortress
- player fights upwards through fortress and loses resources (if he runs out uh oh)
- player gets something (ability?)
- player leaves fortress
- player runs through the world map gathering resources trying not to get killed
- player uses his new ability to get to the other fortress

# MDA Framework:

## Mechanics: 
- Jumping
- Movement
- Sword swinging(maybe follow mouse mechanic)
- Light currency (you get this from enemies, everytime you swing your sword you lose light)
- Light currency can enchant sword for swings to have less light needed
- Completing fortresses upgrades abilities (very vague)
## Dynamics:
- Completing levels quickly
- Conserving light currency
## Aesthetics:
- Horror music
- Pixel art
- Darkness with lantern
- Dark forest
